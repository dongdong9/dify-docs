# Integrating with GPUStack for Local Model Deployment

[GPUStack](https://github.com/gpustack/gpustack) is an open-source GPU cluster manager for running large language models(LLMs).

Dify allows integration with GPUStack for local deployment of large language model inference, embedding and reranking capabilities.

## Deploying GPUStack

You can refer to the official [Documentation](https://docs.gpustack.ai) for deployment, or quickly integrate following the steps below:

### Linux or MacOS

GPUStack provides a script to install it as a service on systemd or launchd based systems. To install GPUStack using this method, just run:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.gpustack.ai | sh -s -
```

### Windows

Run PowerShell as administrator (**avoid** using PowerShell ISE), then run the following command to install GPUStack:

```powershell
Invoke-Expression (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://get.gpustack.ai" -UseBasicParsing).Content
```

Then you can follow the printed instructions to access the GPUStack UI.

## Deploying Models

We will use a large language model as an example:

1. In GPUStack UI, navigate to the "Models" page and click on "Deploy Model", choose `Hugging Face` from the dropdown.

2. Use the search bar in the top left to search for the model name `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF`.

3. Click `Save` to deploy the model.

## Create an API Key

1. Navigate to the "API Keys" page and click on "New API Key".

2. Fill in the name, then click `Save`.

3. Copy the API key and save it for later use.

## Integrating GPUStack into Dify

5. Go to `Settings > Model Providers > GPUStack` and fill in:

   - Model Type: `LLM`

   - Model Name: `qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct`

   - Server URL: `http://your-gpustack-server-ip`

   - API Key: `Input the API key you copied from previous steps`

   Click "Save" to use the model in the application.
